The purpose of this test is test a selection involving a join between two tables. This is meant to
be run **after** all runLCSV tests. To run the test:

Make each script executable.
`chmod +x test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.pre test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.post`

Start the daemons.
`./test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.pre`

Execute the test. Direct the output to some file.
`python3 runSQL.py test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.cfg test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.sql | sort > /tmp/test4-glennga-1.out`

Verify the output of the join.
`diff /tmp/test4-glennga-1.out test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.exp`

To verify the state of the database, check for any differences between the POST and the expected:
`./test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.post | sort > /tmp/test4-glennga-1.post.exp`
`diff /tmp/test4-glennga-1.post.exp test/runJSQL/test4-glennga-1.post.exp`
